				<h3>Children’s Cancer Center</h3>
				<p class="paragraphtext">The Children’s Cancer Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving children and their families who are battling cancer or chronic blood disorders with the emotional, financial, and educational support necessary to cope with their life-threatening illness. Volunteers play a vital role in this organization, and volunteering opportunities are tailored to the volunteer’s interests and schedule.

				<h3>Judeo Christian Health Center</h3>
				<p class="paragraphtext">The Judeo Christian Health Center began in 1972 to serve the needs of those who are uninsured and who cannot afford to see a doctor privately. Volunteers play a vital role with patient interactions, but also could serve administrative roles as well. As many of the patients at the Clinic speak Spanish as their first language, there is an urgent need for fluent Spanish speaking volunteers to communicate with patients and help the doctors in translation. To help with patient interactions though, volunteers must obtain parental consent and be at least 18 years of age. Volunteers under the age of 18 (minimum of 16 years) will be given more administrative roles. For more information visit: <a href="https://www.judeochristianhealthclinic.org/volunteering">https://www.judeochristianhealthclinic.org/volunteering</a>. <br> <br> <em>Please include the timings you are available to volunteer and the languages you speak in your volunteer application.</em> </p>
